## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](./style.css) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned to switch the image for desktop and mobile by using the display styles. When it doesn't show let it display=none and wants to show let display=block or any value.

```css
.imgDesktop {
  display: none;
}

.imgMobile {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
}
```
